### Core team

[**Paul Tackley**](https://erdw.ethz.ch/personen/profil.paul-tackley.html) (PI, ETHZ)

> Professor of Geophysical Fluid Dynamics in the Institute of Geophysics, Department of Earth Sciences at ETH Zurich. His research focuses on the application of high-performance computing to model large-scale geodynamic problems related to mantle convection, plate tectonics, and the long-term evolution of Earth and planets.

[**Alan Edelman**](https://math.mit.edu/~edelman/) (co-PI, MIT)

> Professor of applied mathematics and leading the Julia laboratory in the Computer Science & AI Laboratory at MIT, chief scientist at Julia Computing. Edelman works on High Performance Computing, numerical computation, linear algebra, random matrix theory, and geometry.

[**Boris Kaus**](https://github.com/boriskaus) (co-PI, JGU)

> Professor of geodynamics and geophysics at the Institute of Geosciences, and at the Center for Computational Sciences at the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz. His research focuses on the development and application of high-performance software tools to understand geological processes, with respect to crustal and lithospheric-scale deformation.

[**Taras Gerya**](https://geophysics.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.MTE3Nzky.TGlzdC84MjEsMTE4NDAwMzQxMg==.html) (co-PI, ETHZ)

> Titular Professor at the Institute of Geophysics, ETH Zurich. His research focuses on application of high-performance computing for numerical modeling of geodynamical and planetary processes at a broad range of scales from local to global.

[**Ludovic RÃ¤ss**](https://github.com/luraess) (co-PI, ETHZ)

> Postdoctoral researcher at the Laboratory of Hydraulics, Hydrology and Glaciology (VAW) at ETH Zurich. His research focuses on the development and application of high-performance and scalable software tools to further understand the localisation of flow and deformation in ice and porous rocks.

[**Patrick Sanan**](https://github.com/psanan) (co-PI, ETHZ - Argonne)

> Postdoctoral researcher in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Group in the Institute of Geophysics, Department of Earth Sciences at ETH Zurich. His interests include scalable solvers for physical simulation, scientific software, and applied mathematics.

[**Sam Omlin**](https://github.com/omlins) (CSCS)

> Computational scientist at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre, CSCS, part of ETH Zurich.

[**Ivan Utkin**](https://github.com/utkinis) (ETHZ)

> Postdoctoral researcher at the Laboratory of Hydraulics, Hydrology and Glaciology (VAW) at ETH Zurich.

[**Albert De Montserrat**](https://github.com/albert-de-montserrat) (ETHZ)

> Postdoctoral researcher in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Group in the Institute of Geophysics, Department of Earth Sciences at ETH Zurich.

[**Valentin Churavy**]() (MIT)

> Graduate Student at MIIT CSAIL & Julia Lab, working on distributed heterogeneous computing with Julia.
