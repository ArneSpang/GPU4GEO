## A EuroHPC Success Story: Improved modelling of ice flow to better anticipate sea-level rise
*Ludovic RÃ¤ss*

Our on-going ice flow modelling efforts using AMD GPUs on the European flagship supercomputer LUMI are now featured in an online interview with EuroHPC about **Improved modelling of ice flow to better anticipate sea-level rise**.

> The STREAM research team believes that new techniques in high-performance extreme-scale GPU computing will revolutionise ice flow modelling in the future and provide more accurate predictions. The team tackled the complexities of ice flow dynamics by employing a computational approach that involves solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on GPUs.

### Latest results

Amongst the latest result, we are now working towards resolving the [Vavilov ice cap](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/144790/a-surprising-surge-at-vavilov-ice-cap) in order to understand the processes that lead to the [rapid destabilisation of ice](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2018.08.049) and the formation of an ice stream.

These preliminary results already suggest an acceleration of flow in the region of the ice flow instability.

In the coming steps, we will refine the numerical resolution and activate the coupling to perform time-dependant simulations.
