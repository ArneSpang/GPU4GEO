We successfully launched a test simulation of a 2D linear diffusion on AMD MI250x using ROCm-aware MPI on OLCF Crusher system.

During the Julia hackathon in April 2022, we finalised AMDGPU support ([AMDGPU.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/AMDGPU.jl) ROCm programming) in [MPI.jl](https://github.com/JuliaParallel/MPI.jl) and [ImplicitGlobalGrid.jl](https://github.com/eth-cscs/ImplicitGlobalGrid.jl) for both ROCm-aware and standard AMDGPU-MPI capabilities.

We are thrilled to announce that the 2D diffusion solver successfully executed on 8 AMD MI250x GPUs using ROCm-aware MPI on [OLCF](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov)'s Crusher test system, a small replica of Frontier, the first exascale supercomputer:

```julia-repl

Executed 1000 steps in = 2.679e+00 sec (@ T_eff = 595.00 GB/s) 
```

The code and setup can be found in [https://github.com/luraess/ROCm-MPI](https://github.com/luraess/ROCm-MPI). On Crusher, we used Julia 1.8.0-rc1 and ROCm 5.1.0.

Thanks to William F. Godoy (OLCF) for having performed the tests.
