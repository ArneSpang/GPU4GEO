The [GPU4GEO team](/team) and external collaborators will gather for the 7th Julia hackathon :tada:, **March 24 - 28 2025** to advance geoscientific Julia projects.

## GPU4GEO Julia hackathon

After six successful editions, we are happy to announce a 7th edition of the Julia hackathon, to be held in October 2025 in the Black Forest.

**Save the dates: March 24 - 28 2025**

During this event, we aim at moving forward with the various open-source Julia projects within ice-flow dynamics and geodynamics where collaboration with experts enables the fast track.

Namely, we will focus on advancing Julia software engineering and high-performance, parallel, GPU-accelerated code development in following topics:

- Work on AD capabilities using [Enzyme.jl](https://github.com/EnzymeAD/Enzyme.jl) on GPUs
- Further develop rheology and material parameter routines [GeoParams.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeodynamics/GeoParams.jl) and use/implement that in existing codes
- Advance several "differentiable modelling" projects
- more...

Participant will team-up among topics of interest and work on their selected challenges in small groups during the week.

Stay tuned as more news will follow...
