The "Julia for HPC" minisymposium aims to gather current and prospective Julia practitioners in the field of high-performance computing (HPC) from multidisciplinary applications. We invite participation from industry, academia, and government institutions interested in Juliaâ€™s capabilities for supercomputing. The goal is to provide a venue for Julia enthusiasts to share best practices, discuss current limitations, and identify future developments in the scientific HPC community.

#### Presentations

|  Time  |  Title   | Presenter |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| 16:05 - 16:15 CEST | Scalability of the Julia/GPU stack | Samuel Omlin (CSCS) |
| 17:35 - 17:50 CEST | Julia and GPU-HPC for geoscience applications | Ludovic RÃ¤ss (ETH Zurich) |

Live stream recording soon available on YouTube: ðŸš§
